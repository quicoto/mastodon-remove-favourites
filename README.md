# Mastodon remove favourites

Periodically removes old favourites using the great [Mastodon.py](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py)

It tries to queries 40 favourites, if you have 40 or more it will cut 20 off and unfavourite them.

This is just an experiment to keep the user's account lean of favourites, just keep the most recent.
